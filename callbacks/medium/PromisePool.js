// Problem Description – Asynchronous Worker Pool

// You are required to create a worker pool that manages the execution of asynchronous tasks. 
// The pool should ensure that no more than N tasks are running concurrently, while any additional tasks are queued. 
// As tasks complete, queued tasks should start automatically.
// Each task must resolve with its own result.
